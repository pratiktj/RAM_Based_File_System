ABOUT RAM_Based_File_System

1. In this project, I emulate all the data structures used by the operating system to manage file system-oriented tasks.
2. As the name suggests, it's virtual because I maintain all the records in primary storage (RAM).
3. In this project, I create all the data structures required for file subsystems, such as FT, UAREA, UFDT, SB, DILB, DB, etc.
4. I provide implementations for all necessary system calls and commands of file subsystems, such as open, close, read, write, lseek, create, rm, ls, stat, fstat, etc.
5. While creating this project, I use the mentioned functionalities by referring to the algorithms of the UNIX operating system.
6. Using this project, I can get an overview of UFS (UNIX File System) on any platform.
